# Complex Web Server on Microsoft Azure

This project demonstrates how to set up a complex web server on Microsoft Azure that can handle HTTP requests and serve various types of content including XML, JSON, CSV, and HTML. It also includes routing based on HTTP request objects using Node.js and Express.

## Description

The web server is capable of responding to client requests with different types of data formats. It uses Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have a Microsoft Azure account.
* You have installed Node.js and npm on your local machine or Azure VM.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your web server:

1. **Set up Azure Environment:**
   * Log in to the Azure Portal and create a new resource group.
   * Deploy a new Virtual Machine (VM) with Ubuntu Server.

2. **Connect to your VM:**
   * Use SSH to connect to your newly created VM.

3. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install nodejs
   sudo apt-get install npm

    Set up your project:

    bash

    mkdir my-web-server
    cd my-web-server
    npm init -y
    npm install express --save

    Create your server file:
    Create a new file named server.js in your project directory.

Usage

Below is the example code to include in your server.js file:

javascript

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Route for serving HTML content
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!'); // Send HTML as a string
});

// Route for serving JSON content
app.get('/data.json', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This is a JSON response' });
});

// Route for serving XML content
app.get('/data.xml', (req, res) => {
  res.set('Content-Type', 'text/xml');
  res.send('<message>This is an XML response</message>');
});

// Route for serving CSV content
app.get('/data.csv', (req, res) => {
  res.set('Content-Type', 'text/csv');
  res.send('message,This is a CSV response');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});

To run the server, execute:

bash

node server.js

The server will start and listen on port 3000. You can then make requests to your Azure VM's public IP address at the specified port to receive different types of responses.

This `README.md` is structured to be as clear and as easy to follow as possible, providing a guide on setting up and running the server along with the sample code.
